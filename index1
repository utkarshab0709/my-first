                        <p>
                            you remember the first time you saw me in your home.
                            It was simple, natural, and somehow... perfect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We started as friends, just talking, sharing little moments. But somewhere along the way,
                            those little moments became the best part of my day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Slowly, beautifully, unexpectedly.
                            One day I woke up and realized—you weren't just my friend anymore. You were everything.

                            We had our own world, didn't we? Late night conversations that turned into early mornings.
                            Inside jokes that no one else understood. Comfortable silences that said more than words
                            ever could.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You made ordinary days feel special. A simple walk, a random song, a silly argument—
                            everything felt magical when I was with you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I felt safe with you. Like I could be myself completely, without fear of judgment.
                            You saw all of me—the good, the bad, the messy parts—and you stayed.

                            But love isn't always easy, is it? We had our struggles. Misunderstandings that hurt.
                            Words said in anger that we didn't mean. Moments when we didn't know how to reach each
                            other.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There were times when silence felt heavy, when distance felt unbearable.
                            Times when I wondered if we could make it through.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But even in those hard moments, I never stopped caring. Even when we fought,
                            even when it hurt, my heart still chose you. Every single time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Right now, we're not talking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I made mistakes. I hurt you when I should have protected your heart.
                            I was careless with something precious. I took for granted what I should have treasured.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The silence between us now—it's the loudest thing I've ever heard.
                            Every day without you feels incomplete. Every moment reminds me of what I lost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm not making excuses. I'm not blaming anyone but myself.
                            I just want you to know—I see my mistakes. I feel the weight of them.
                            And I'm truly, deeply sorry.

                        <p>
                            You deserve better than the hurt I caused. You deserve someone who cherishes you,
                            respects you, and never makes you feel like you're not enough.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I want to be that person for you. Not the person I was when I made those mistakes,
                            but someone better. Someone who has learned, who has grown, who understands the value of
                            what we had.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I know I can't erase the past. I can't take back the hurt.
                            But I can promise to do better. To be better. To love you the way you deserve to be loved.
